An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)  ( JDK 18)  framework in Java allows developers to interact with databases using Java objects instead of SQL queries. 
It maps Java classes to database tables, simplifying data manipulation and retrieval,allowing developers to easily map Java objects to MySQL tables,
making it easier to manage and manipulate data within your applications

Benefit of using this framework.

1.	No need to write SQL statements for insertion,deletion,retrival and updation.

2. No need to apply validations related to data.

3. No need to create pojo's for the database tables, all the pojos will be created in the specified folder structure and jar file will be created of compiled pojo's.
   
4. User only need to create a file named as conf.json in the working directory that contains required information to establish connection with the database.
